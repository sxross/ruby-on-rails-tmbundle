[Edge] Trundle to Rails 2.0 Bundle
Ruby on Rails bundle maintenance has been taken over by Dr Nic Williams from its initial legendary creator Duane Johnson.

      * REMOVED: render_component snippets
    * Views
      * form_for (ff)
    * Models
      * has_many :though (hmt)
      * association snippets give better defaults (e.g. bt + hm)
  * Language upgrades
    * New keywords: rescue_from
  * Commands
